### 🌱 Currently Learning
I am currently developing a web application using Java and Angular for energy management. I am looking for job opportunities where I can advance my career by combining IoT and web application development.

### 🌟 Fun Fact
I enjoy cooking Japanese food as a hobby. Recently, I made nikuman (steamed buns filled with meat and vegetables) and gyoza (pan-fried dumplings). I have a particular love for Japanese-style Chinese cuisine!
